    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        100% on-device. No servers. No uploads. Ever. Your data never leaves your phone. Not even we can see it.
    </div>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect nothing. Zero. Nada.</p>
    <p>InnerMirror runs entirely on your device. All AI processing, all data storage, all voice generation happens locally on your phone. Nothing is transmitted to any server, ever.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your data—messages, photos, health data, journal entries, secrets—is stored locally on your device using industry-standard encryption.</p>
    <p>Your secrets vault uses SQLCipher encryption. Your life log is stored in encrypted JSON files. Your voice model is stored locally.</p>
    <p>We cannot access your data. We cannot see your data. We have no servers to store it on.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use zero third-party analytics. Zero tracking. Zero advertising networks.</p>
    <p>The only external connection is for downloading the initial AI model from Hugging Face (a public, open-source model repository). After download, everything runs offline.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>InnerMirror requests permissions to:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 24px; color: #aaaaaa;">
        <li>Read messages (to understand your communication patterns)</li>
        <li>Access photos (to analyze your visual life)</li>
        <li>Access health data (to understand your physical patterns)</li>
        <li>Access location (to understand where you create and live)</li>
        <li>Use microphone (for voice journaling and voice cloning)</li>
        <li>Use biometrics (to lock your secrets vault)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this data stays on your device. None of it is transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You own your data. You can delete it at any time by uninstalling the app. Your secrets vault has a "Burn Day" feature that permanently deletes everything on December 31st.</p>
    <p>Since we don't collect or store your data, there's nothing for us to share, sell, or delete on our end.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>InnerMirror is rated 17+ and is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we ever change this policy (we won't—we still won't collect data), we'll update this page. But since we don't collect data, there's nothing to change.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions? Contact us at privacy@innermirror.app</p>
    <p>But remember: we can't see your data, so we can't help you recover it if you lose your phone. That's the price of complete privacy.</p>
